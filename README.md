# Adobe Sparkle SSR

This is derivative fork of https://github.com/lucianfelix/sparkle-demo demonstrating mixed rendering with Next.js:
* * Static Site Generation (built time html generation, and reused at each request)
* * regular Server-side Rendering (html is generated on each request)

In both situations data fetching happens server side.

Note that the original uses Client Side Rendering with React. Same components are used here, only the data fatching functions are diferent.


See origin readme for more info.
